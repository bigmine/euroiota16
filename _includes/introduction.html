<p> The European IoT Analytics Summit is a meeting place for both academia, government and industr
y to discuss upcoming challenges of IoT data mining, machine learning and data science methods.
</p>
                    <p>
The  Internet of Things (IoT), the large network of physical devices that extends
 beyond the typical computer networks, will be creating a huge quantity of data
 in real time in the next future.
 The realization of IoT depends on being able to gain the insights hidden in the vast and growing seas of data available.
Since current approaches don't scale to Internet of Things (IoT) volumes,
 new systems with novel mining techniques are necessary due to the velocity, but also variety,
and variability, of such data. There is a great deal of interest in analyzing data from IoT.
</p>
<p>
The main
goal for this year's event is to bring together top researchers
from academia, as well as top data scientists from industry and
government with the special focus of evolving infrastructures for IoT.
</p><p>
EuroIoTA 2016 will take place in Paris on November 24th.
</p><p>
The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p><ul>
<li>IoT Data Analytics,</li>
<li>Data Mining for IoT</li>
<li>Machine Learning for IoT</li>
<li>IoT &amp; Data Stream Mining</li>
