                  </p><hr><p>8:45-9:00 Welcome Talk by Yves Poilane, Director of Télécom ParisTech
                  </p><hr><p>9:00-10:00 Keynote Talk: <b> Michael May</b>, Siemens Corporate Technology, <b> Towards Industrial Machine Intelligence</b>
</p><p>The next decade will see a deep transformation of industrial applications by big data analytics, machine learning and the internet of things. Industrial applications have a number of unique features, setting them apart from other domains. Central for many industrial applications in the internet of things is time series data generated by often hundreds or thousands of sensors at a high rate, e.g. by a turbine or a smart grid. In a first wave of applications this data is centrally collected and analyzed in Map-Reduce or streaming systems for condition monitoring, root cause analysis, or predictive maintenance. The next step is to shift from centralized analysis to distributed in-field or in situ analytics, e.g in smart cities or smart grids. The final step will be a distributed, partially autonomous decision making and learning in massively distributed environments.

</p><p>In this talk I will give an overview on Siemens’ journey through this transformation, highlight early successes, products and prototypes and point out future challenges on the way towards machine intelligence. I will also discuss architectural challenges for such systems from a Big Data point of view.

<b>Biography:</b> Michael May is Head of the Technology Field Business Analytics & Monitoring at Siemens Corporate Technology, Munich, and responsible for eleven research groups in Europe, US, and Asia. Michael is driving research at Siemens in data analytics, machine learning and big data architectures. In the last two years he was responsible for creating the Sinalytics platform for Big Data applications across Siemens’ business.
</p><p>
Before joining Siemens in 2013, Michael was Head of the Knowledge Discovery Department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems in Bonn, Germany. In cooperation with industry he developed Big Data Analytics applications in sectors ranging from telecommunication, automotive, and retail to finance and advertising.
</p><p>
Between 2002 and 2009 Michael coordinated two Europe-wide Data Mining Research Networks (KDNet, KDubiq). He was local chair of ICML 2005, ILP 2005 and program chair of the ECML/PKDD Industrial Track 2015. Michael did his PhD on machine discovery of causal relationships at the Graduate Programme for Cognitive Science at the University of Hamburg.

</p><p>
The evolution of cellular networks is driven by the dream of ubiquitous wireless connectivity: Any data service is instantly accessible  everywhere. With each generation of cellular networks, we have moved closer to this wireless dream; first by delivering wireless access to voice communications, then by providing wireless data services, and recently by delivering a WiFi-like experience with wide-area coverage and user mobility management. The support for high data rates has been the main objective in recent years, as seen from the academic focus on sum-rate optimization and the efforts from standardization bodies to meet the peak rate requirements specified in IMT-Advanced. In contrast, a variety of metrics/objectives are put forward in the technological preparations for 5G networks: higher peak rates, improved coverage with uniform user experience, higher reliability and lower latency, better energy efficiency, lower-cost user devices and services, better scalability with number of devices, etc. These multiple objectives are coupled, often in a conflicting manner such that improvements in one objective lead to degradation in the other objectives. Hence, the design of future networks calls for new optimization tools that properly handle the existence and tradeoffs between multiple objectives. In this talk, we will adress these challenges and describe the actual proposed technologies able to meet these requirements.

</p><p><b>Biography</b>: Mérouane Debbah entered the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan (France) in 1996 where he received his M.Sc and Ph.D. degrees respectively. He worked for Motorola Labs (Saclay, France) from 1999-2002 and the Vienna Research Center for Telecommunications (Vienna, Austria) until 2003. From 2003 to 2007, he joined the Mobile Communications department of the Institut Eurecom (Sophia Antipolis, France) as an Assistant Professor. Since 2007, he is a Full Professor at CentraleSupelec (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). From 2007 to 2014, he was the director of the Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio. Since 2014, he is Vice-President of the Huawei France R&D center and director of the Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab. His research interests lie in fundamental mathematics, algorithms, statistics, information & communication sciences research. He is an Associate Editor in Chief of the journal Random Matrix: Theory and Applications and was an associate and senior area editor for IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing respectively in 2011-2013 and 2013-2014. Mérouane Debbah is a recipient of the ERC grant MORE (Advanced Mathematical Tools for Complex Network Engineering). He is a IEEE Fellow, a WWRF Fellow and a member of the academic senate of Paris-Saclay. He has managed 8 EU projects and more than 24 national and international projects. He received 14 best paper awards, among which the 2007 IEEE GLOBECOM best paper award, the Wi-Opt 2009 best paper award, the 2010 Newcom++ best paper award, the WUN CogCom Best Paper 2012 and 2013 Award, the 2014 WCNC best paper award, the 2015 ICC best paper award, the 2015 IEEE Communications Society Leonard G. Abraham Prize and 2015 IEEE Communications Society Fred W. Ellersick Prize as well as the Valuetools 2007, Valuetools 2008, CrownCom2009, Valuetools 2012 and SAM 2014 best student paper awards.
